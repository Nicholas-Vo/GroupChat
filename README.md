A Minecraft plugin that introduces a group chat feature where players can create groups which will allow them to talk privately amongst their group members!

Upon creating a group, you become the group leader. A leader can promote other members to the rank of captain, which will allow them to invite and kick other players. There is no member limit to a group by default.
